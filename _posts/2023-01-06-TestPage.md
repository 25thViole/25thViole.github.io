**Types of laws**
- _Criminal Law_ – A system of laws concerned with crimes and the punishment of individuals who commit them. The government (prosecutor) accuses an individual or entity (defendant) of violating criminal statutes. The prosecutor is responsible for proving the defendants guild and the defendant is responsible for challenging it. Burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.
    - **Felonies**: A serious crime punishable by at least one year of state or federal prison, and up to death. Examples include arson, fraud, assault, grand larceny, murder, etc.
    - **Misdemeanors**: A lesser crime punishable by a fine and/or county jail time for up to one year. Examples include petty theft, public intoxication, reckless driving, and trespassing.
- **Civil Law** – A legal system focused on resolving disputes between private individuals or entities through the adjudication of a court. In civil law a plaintiff accuses the defendant for perceived wrong and seeks remedy. The burden of proof is a preponderance of evidence, requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate that it’s more likely than not that the defendant is responsible for the alleged harm. Examples of civil cases include breaches of contracts, personal injuries, property disputes, and family matters. Remedies are typically compensation, injunction, or compelled actions through court orders.
- **Regulatory Law** (AKA Administrative Law) – For holding organizations accountable when failing to comply with regulatory requirements, or challenging government decisions when actions are perceived to be inconsistent with the law.

**Additional definitions**
- **Common law (case law)** – When court decisions make new interpretations of the law and, therefore, can be cited as precedent.
- **Statutory law** – When law is created by legislative bodies through the enactment of statutes or laws.

**Internal Investigations**
It's worth noting that when an employee violates or is alleged to have violated a policy, the inventigation is handled internally. The penalties for finding an employee guilty are labor related, such as a suspension, demotion, or firing. If it is determined that the employee has also violated a law or restitution is required, then the employer may report the crime or sue the individual.
