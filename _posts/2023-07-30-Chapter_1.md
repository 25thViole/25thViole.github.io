## Chapter 1

Failure of a new leadership program and the inspiration for improving

# The Inspiration

Marquet first experienced the leadership-leadership model that is the central theme of Turn the Ship Around! while aboard the USS Sunship. He decided to implement the same approach while serving as a department head aboard the SSBN Will Rogers.

The Sunfish-inspired plan was to give control rather than orders to his department. Examples:

| Old Tactics | New Tactics|
| :--- | :--- |
| Give specific lists of tasks to the division officers and chiefs | Give broad guidance to division officers and chiefs, and they prepare task lists for Marquet to review |
| Give orders to everyone under his command to tell them what to do | Ask questions about how they thought we should approach a problem |
| Be the central hub coordinating maintenance between two division | Allow division chiefs to talk directly to each other |

# Just tell us what to do

Failures were immediately seen as work would not start on time due to delays in assembling parts, obtaining permissions, and establishing other necessary conditions for work. On top of this there were maintenance errors that resulted in a redo of work.

Marquet had overhead crew members stating to “tell them what to do”.

Soon this behavior led to a catastrophic failure of improper installment of nuts that could cause a fully submerged submarine to fail.

Marquet  reverted back to the old style of leadership:
- Personally briefed every event
- Approved all events
- Set up a system to be reported to independent of time of day
