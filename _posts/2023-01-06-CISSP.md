<span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight:bold;"> Intellectual Property </span>

The intangible creations of the human intellect that are protected under law, affording the creator certain rights in the making, use, and selling of their creation for a limited time. There are four categories recognized in the United Stated: copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret. Other countries may have more or less IP categories.

In cybersecurity things like secure communication protocols, cryptographic algorithms, biometric technologies, and innovative cloud computing solutions are protected under patents.

**Copyright**

A form of protection provided by the laws of the Untied States to the authors of “original works of authorship” (i.e., songs, books, movies, and sculptures) that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. An original work of authorship is a work that is independently creaed by a human author and possess at least some minimal degree of creativity.
- Example: The book Hacking APIs published by No Start Press. [Here's their Copyright registration](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=16&ti=1,16&Search%5FArg=hacking&Search%5FCode=TALL&CNT=25&PID=ALcoiuXte0L7IXWxpNoBsCPLFEN7&SEQ=20240107212325)
- Registration: Registration through the Library of Congress provides several benefits including suing for statutory damages in cases of infrigement. Original works of authorship are protected under copyright the moment they are created (fixed on a medium), to a limited degree.
- Copyright symbol: the © symbol represents that the work is copyrighted. The © symbol can be used whether or not the work is registered.
- Fair use doctrine: Provides others with limited unlicensed use of copyrighted material for the purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/)
- First sale doctrine: Provides an individual that has purchased a copyrighted work with limited rights for the purpose of re-selling, renting, giving away, or destroying without the need of a license or permission from the copyright owner.
- International copyright agreements: The US has ratified a range of copyright treaties administered by the WIPO.

**Trademark**

A trademark can be any word, phrase, symbol, design, or a combination of these things that identifies your goods or services. It’s how customers recognize you in the marketplace and distinguish you from your competitors. Note that trademarking words does not keep other from using that word, unless it’s to promote a product and decieve a user of the origin.
- Example: The Cisco logo. [Here's their trademark statement](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac50/ac47/downloads/logo/trademark.pdf)
- Registration: Something is considered trademarked the moment it is used in commerce to identify and distinguish a good or service. A trademark can also be registered with the USPTO at a national level for further protections and legal backing.
- Trademark symbol: The ™ symbol is used to identify that something is trademarked, and the ℠ symbol for something that is service marked, and neither require registration. The ® symbol indicates that the trademark or service mark has been registered with the USPTO.

**Patent**

A patent gives an inventory the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importingn the claimed invention. The property rights to the invention are granted in exchange for the disclosure of the invention. A patent protects, encourages, and promotes commercialization and application of an invention. There are three types of patents: design, utility, and plant patents.
- Example: Patent US-20240007267-A1 (Click here to see the Side-channel resistance bulk AES encryption patent)[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240007267]
- Registration: Unlike copyright and trademark, patents must be requested within 1 year of public release of the patent or the invention cannot be patentable.
- Patent symbol: The ℗ symbol can be used when patent granted or to indicate a pending patent application.

**Trade Secret**

A trade secret is any information that derives economic value from not being generally known or ascertainable. Can be formulas, patterns, compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, or processes. Trade secrets aren't registered with the USPTO, have state and federal protections, and don't have a limit to how logn they are protected. Two federal laws that protect trade secrets are:
- Economic Espionage Act of 1996: Crimininalizes theft of trade secrets and economic espionage. Economic espionage refers to the theft of a trade secret "intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentatlity, or foreign agent".
- Defense Trade Secrets Act of 2016 - Amends the Economic Espionage Act to establish a private civil cause of action for the misappropriation of a trade secret.

The difference between a trade secret and a patent is that with the trade secret the competitive advantage is derived from the confidentiality of the information.

**World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)**

The WIPO is a specialized agency of the UN whose mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enabled innovatio and creativity for the benefit of all. Currently has 193 member states and provides a global policy forum, where governments, itnergovernmental organizations, industry gorups and civil society come together to address evolving IP issues. They have  have departments that the USPTO works with to protect IP:
- Trademark: [Madrid System - The international Trademark System](https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/)
- Copyright: [WIPO Copyright Treaty](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/)
- Patent: [PCT - The international Patent Corportation Treaty](https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/)

<span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight:bold;"> Import/export controls </span>
Countries  may have restrictions on the import/export of security relevant software or strong cryptographic algorithms. Requiring that encryption algorithms in software that is exported either have weak encryption algorithms (typically one that the government can bypass) or that the private key be provided to the governemtn. One international agreement of importance is the Wassenaar Arrangement.
- The wassenaar Arrangement costs of 42 countries that agree to restricts import/export of conventional weapons, including dual-use goods and technologies. They maintain a list is maintained that controls the products, components, and technologies that can be exported: https://www.wassenaar.org/control-lists/



#### <font color="#007800"><b>1.6 Understand requirements for investigation types (i.e., administrative, criminal, civil, regulatory, industry standards) </b></font>
This section contains an overview of the different legal branches in the US, and helps to determine the proper path for recourse.

**Types of laws**
- <u>Criminal Law</u> – A system of laws concerned with crimes and the punishment of individuals who commit them. The government (prosecutor) accuses an individual or entity (defendant) of violating criminal statutes. The prosecutor is responsible for proving the defendants guild and the defendant is responsible for challenging it. Burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. Crimes are broken down into two categories:
    - <u>Felonies</u>: A serious crime punishable by at least one year of state or federal prison, and up to death. Examples include arson, fraud, assault, grand larceny, murder, etc.
    - <u>Misdemeanors</u>: A lesser crime punishable by a fine and/or county jail time for up to one year. Examples include petty theft, public intoxication, reckless driving, and trespassing.
- <u>Civil Law</u> – A legal system focused on resolving disputes between private individuals or entities through the adjudication of a court. In civil law a plaintiff accuses the defendant for perceived wrong and seeks remedy. The burden of proof is a preponderance of evidence, requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate that it’s more likely than not that the defendant is responsible for the alleged harm. Examples of civil cases include breaches of contracts, personal injuries, property disputes, and family matters. Remedies are typically compensation, injunction, or compelled actions through court orders.
- <u>Regulatory Law</u> (AKA Administrative Law) – For holding organizations accountable when failing to comply with regulatory requirements, or challenging government decisions when actions are perceived to be inconsistent with the law.

How laws are created in the US
- <u>Common law (case law)</u> – When court decisions make new interpretations of the law and, therefore, can be cited as precedent.
- <u>Statutory law</u> – When law is created by legislative bodies through the enactment of statutes or laws.

**Internal Investigations**

It's worth noting that when an employee violates or is alleged to have violated a policy, the inventigation is handled internally. The penalties for finding an employee guilty are labor related, such as a suspension, demotion, or firing. If it is determined that the employee has also violated a law or restitution is required, then the employer may report the crime or sue the individual.
